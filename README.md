# IR-Remote

This repository has all the documentation, design and process in creating an IR remote
for a Dynex television using the NEC protocol and an ATtiny85 microcontroller. The goal 
is to create a maximum range IR remote for my girlfriends' TV that will be reliable, easy to use, 
have long battery life and look/work functionally equivilent to a regular TV remote.
